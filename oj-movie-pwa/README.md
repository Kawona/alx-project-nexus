# OJ Movies – Movie Discovery Web App



This is my final project for the ALX Software Engineering program.
OJ Movies is a simple web application where you can explore movies, check details, save movies to your watchlist, and watch trailers. I built it using React and The Movie Database (TMDB) API. This project helped me practice everything I learned in frontend development.



## Features

- Browse popular, top-rated, and now-playing movies

- Search for any movie using the search bar

- View full movie details (poster, description, actors, ratings, etc.)

- Watch trailers (YouTube)

- Add movies to your personal watchlist

- Remove movies from watchlist

- Fully responsive UI

- Hosted online so anyone can use it



## What I Learned

- Working on this project helped me understand:

- How to fetch data from APIs

- How to manage state in React

- How to use React Router

- How to handle watchlists with localStorage

- How to deploy a React app online

- How to structure a real project

- How to build responsive layouts

## Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience for me.
It brought together everything I have been studying and helped me build confidence.
I hope you enjoy exploring movies using OJ Movies.
